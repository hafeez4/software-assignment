				"Summary"
This paper was totally about the quality of software that are demanded by users now a now
according to needs of daily life, in this paper the existing infrastructure is discussed that are used
in industry for digital re-imagination of software and system processes. 
This paper contained information about  an ISPIN named framework that is useful 
in digital re-imagination of software and systems lifecycle processes. This framework is 
implemented using digital technolgies,they propose this framework for building an intelligent 
software process infrastructure, The proposed iSPIN framework will help in unprecedented automation and quality engineering at each process step and paves the way towards realizing the dictums of “Quality at Speed” and “Digital transformation of Software Process”. 

Research Methodology: This research paper starts to discuss that how software quality is important
and how much now a days is demanded by users, and ends at a proposed iSPIN framework implemented
using digital technologies that will be useful at "Quality at Speed" and "Digital transformation of software process.


Results: This paper realizes that how much software qulity is important and day by day it is increasing
according to needs of users.

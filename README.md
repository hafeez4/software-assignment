				"Summary"
This paper was totally about the quality of software that are demanded by users now a now
according to needs of daily life, in this paper the existing infrastructure is discussed that are used
in industry for digital re-imagination of software and system processes. 
This paper contained information about  an ISPIN named framework that is useful 
in digital re-imagination of software and systems lifecycle processes. This framework is 
implemented using digital technolgies,they propose this framework for building an intelligent 
software process infrastructure, The proposed iSPIN framework will help in unprecedented automation and quality engineering at each process step and paves the way towards realizing the dictums of “Quality at Speed” and “Digital transformation of Software Process”. 

Research Methodology: This research paper starts to discuss that how software quality is important
and how much now a days is demanded by users, and ends at a proposed iSPIN framework implemented
using digital technologies that will be useful at "Quality at Speed" and "Digital transformation of software process.


Results: This paper realizes that how much software qulity is important and day by day it is increasing
according to needs of users.

SUMMARY:

The researcher report on a longitudinal case study conducted at the Italian site
of a large software company to further our understanding of how
development and communication tools can be improved to better
support agile practices and collaboration. After observing inconsistencies in the way 
communication tools (i.e., email, Skype, andSlack) were used, we first reinforced 
the use of Slack as the central hub for internal communication, while setting clear rules regarding
tools usage. As a second main change, we refactored the Jira Scrum
board into two separate boards, a detailed one for developers and
a high-level one for managers, while also introducing automation
rules and the integration with Slack. The first change revealed that
the teams of developers used and appreciated Slack differently with
the QA team being the most favorable and that the use of channels
is hindered by automatic notifications from development tools (e.g.,
Jenkins). The findings from the second change show that 85% of the
interviewees reported perceived improvements in their workflow.
Despite the limitations due to the single nature of the reported case,
we highlight the importance for companies to reflect on how to
properly set up their agile work environment to improve communication and facilitate collaboration.


Research Methodology:

Overall, the case study lasted for about four months, from December
2018 to April 2019. The collection of data happened along the entire
duration of the case study. There were four main data sources,
that is, documentation, direct observations, tools, and interviews, as
detailed next.
Documentation. During the case study, we had access to documentation of different kind, such as PowerPoint presentations
(describing the company’s development process at a higher level,
organization, and product architecture) and Excel spreadsheets (detailing project planning and performance analysis). Other helpful
sources of documentation were the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (SWOT) [8] and Balanced Scorecard [9] analysis
reports, which helped us understand the areas perceived by developers and management as susceptible to improvement.
Overall, the pieces of information retrieved from documentation sources were used to triangulate, integrate, and confirm those
obtained through the direct observation and semi-structured interviews, as described next.
Direct observations. Regarding direct observations, we could
attend 18 different sessions . The company allowed us
to participate in one Grooming session, seven Daily Meetings, and
two Sprint Reviews with the development teams. We agreed not
to take part in Retrospective meetings to avoid the risk of limiting
the free expression of problems reported by the development team
members. We also had the chance to participate in six KSTS-It
Management Board meetings and two Technical Board meetings.

Results:

In this paper, they reported on a case study conducted at KSTS-It,
the Italian site of a large, distributed software company. We analyzed their Agile tooling and work environment, and proposed a
couple of changes in the way they used Slack and Jira to improve
the collaboration. We found out that, overall, KSTS-It accepted the
restructured Slack workspace and the Jira automation rules, and reported more improvements in their communication and workflow.
As future work, KSTS-It is investigating the idea of extending
the role of Slack as a central communication hub by adding more
integrations with other tools, such as Confluence, and expanding
the set of automation rules in Jira. Finally, they are considering also
bringing to Berlin some of the changes investigated at the Italian
site.
